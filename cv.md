### About myself:

I am 32 years old, I got my degree in marine engineering in 2012 and have been working in shipbuilding ever since. I want to become a programmer because I think that this is one of the most important and interesting profession in the present and in the future. I will try to learn and to develop my skills to become a Frontend Developer.
